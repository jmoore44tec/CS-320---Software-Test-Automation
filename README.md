Course work in developing unit tests with JUnit
(Includes Java code and a summary/reflections report)

When developing software it is crucial to develop tests that ensure the program is functional, secure, and meets requirements. Tests should reflect the requirements given for the software and prove functionality of said requirements. Test coverage is important in ensuring trust with the client that the software has been tested extensively to avoid errors or failures down the line as well. 
It is important to not only gather requirements from the client but to also anticipate their needs or improvements to their proposal. By gathering requirements and keeping a good line of communication with stakeholders you work towards a quality product that will satisfy those involved and build trust in not only your agency but your personal ability to develop safe, secure, and efficient software. 
My first step when programming is to spend a good deal of time and attention on the requirments and the implications of said requirements. Impatience leads to mistakes and it is better to do things right the first time. Carefully examining requirements and understanding how they should manifest is always the first step for me.
